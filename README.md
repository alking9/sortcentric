**SortCentric** is a responsive, interactive sorting algorithm visualizer built with React and TypeScript. It highlights each step of the sorting process in real-time, allowing users to observe and compare the inner workings of algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

This project was built as a way to sharpen my front-end skills, apply fundamental algorithms in a visual context, and demonstrate clean architecture with full modularity. It's lightweight, intuitive, and something I'm proud of sharing.

## What It Does

SortCentric lets you:
- Select a sorting algorithm from a dropdown menu
- Generate a randomized array
- Start, stop, and resume the sorting animation
- Watch comparisons, swaps, and merges happen step by step
- See time complexity details for each algorithm

All animations are powered by custom-built sorting logic using a `SortStep` type structure to track each operation accurately.

## Algorithms Implemented

| Algorithm   | Time Complexity |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Bubble Sort | O(nÂ²)           |
| Merge Sort  | O(n log n)      |
| Quick Sort  | O(n log n)      |

Each one was implemented from scratch and animated frame-by-frame with precise tracking of active indices and array states.
